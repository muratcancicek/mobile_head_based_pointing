# Head-based Pointing on Smartphones for People with Motor Impairments

An experimental Android App module that provides an advanced head-based pointing on mobile devices. At this stage, the repo only demonstrates the implementation of an head-based pointing algorithm designed for and evaluated with users with motor impairments rather than proposing a well-packaged extension for third-party usage. The design and evaluation process will be published as a technical paper in [The 22nd International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS2020)](https://assets20.sigaccess.org/). 

Future work will focus to wrap the algorithm into a package that is going to be integrated with Flutter's default UI components and ready for third-party usage as an extension.

## Head-based Pointing

As you may see below, the App demonstrates a dummy cursor with a red circle which is being pointed by the user's head movements measured by the facial landmarks as marked with yellow dots.
